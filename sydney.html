      <p>As the capital of New South Wales, Sydney is the largest city in Australia and is famous for its superb beaches, its vibrant cultural scene and for its cosmopolitan, international population. This beautiful harbor city has a lot to offer budget and luxury travelers. </p> 
      <p>Language: English is the predominant language, although there are also several Asian languages also spoken among their respective communities.</p>
      <p>Currency: The Australian Dollar ($). I found Australia, in general, to be quite expensive compared to most big cities I have traveled to. Meals can easily run $20 AUD and up for something quite casual. Even a meal at Maccas (aka McDonalds) will run you close to $10 AUD. Budget trips are totally doable, but expect to spend some money in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Credit Cards and Banks: There are plenty of ATMs located around the city, while most stores will accept Mastercard and Visa, although acceptance for AMEX is usually only at larger retailers.</p>
      <p>Climate: Sydney enjoys warm summers and mild winters, with even the record lows not dropping below freezing and summer highs regularly over 80 degrees. Cold season is from June until August while warm season is November until February.</p>
      <p>There are so many places in Australia to explore. Plan a camping through the Australian Outback to see places like Uluru and Kata Tijuta!</p>
      <p>The country has a beauty and diversity unlike anywhere else—there’s the cool coastal city of Sydney, the street-art-saturated hub of Melbourne, and all the gorgeous environments in between.</p>
