      <p>Jaipur is easily accessible in 4 hours out of Delhi by train. The best train which I would personally recommend is the Shatabdi express which leaves early in the morning. </p> 
      <p>As a lot of attractions are spread out in Jaipur it’s best to hire a Tuk-Tuk (petrol rickshaw), Tam-Tam (electric rickshaw) or Taxi for the day.</p>
      <p>Nothing in India is ever insignificant, least of all rituals and religion. Fire, in India, revered for being pure, has always played a huge role in any ritual. Hence, a hymn to the Fire God is considered apt when looking to cleanse yourself of earthly sins. Organize an ‘aarti’ just for you, right at your hotel, as the sunsets.</p>
      <p>A priest assembles all the required ingredients, giving you details on the significance of each as the gentle aroma of burning sandalwood fills the air. The aarti is performed for about half an hour and you will be given instructions on specific tasks from chanting to meditating and putting ghee into the fire. The perfect peaceful way to end your day.</p>
      <p>An excellent way to set out a day in India is customary with a visit to the temple; a custom followed by the locals is a visit to Govind Devji Temple in Jaipur’s patron deity.</p>
