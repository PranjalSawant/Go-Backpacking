      <p>Havana makes for an incredible short getaway from Mexico or the United States, even a great long weekend option - travel to Havana Cuba from Miami is around a 45-minute flight.</p>
      <p>If your itinerary allows for a longer time to explore, travel to Havana is just the gateway for so much more to see and do in the rest of Cuba. Just a bus ride or taxi ride outside of the city you’ll find nature reserves with mountains and waterfalls to enjoy, caves to hike, and countless white-sand, untouched beaches. </p> 
      <p>For those looking for a Caribbean vacation but unsatisfied with laying on a beach or being confined to a resort, visiting Havana with a stay at a nearby beach is the best option in the Caribbean. </p>
      <p>You’ll get a mix of cultural exchange and history from this beautiful city, while also enjoying some of the best beaches around -  there is really no better option than Cuba. </p>
      <p>While some things have stayed the same in Havana, Cuba for decades, some things are changing fast: Havana restaurants pop up, open, and close again in just a few months, and things to do in Havana at night constantly evolve and change. </p>
