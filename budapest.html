      <p>Budapest, the grand jewel of the Danube, is one of the most beautiful and budget-friendly capital city in Europe. The city is the paradise for those who like to explore on foot. With beautiful baroque and art nouveau buildings around every corner, you are sure to never run out of things to see here in this city. From things to do during the day, and places to go at night, here are all the information you need to have a great time in Budapest.</p>
      <p>September to October is the best time to visit Budapest as there will be fewer people compared to June - August, the weather is still great and the best of all, the colors of the city started to shift towards autumn so you will be able to see a more colorful side of Budapest, especially up from Buda Castle.</p> 
      <p>Most of the attractions recommended here are all within walking distance and Budapest is best seen on foot so I would recommend you walk as much as you can.</p>
      <p>One of the most important church in Hungary, St. Stephen's Basilica is a great place to admire the beautiful Neo-Classical style architecture and stunning decoration of the interior, especially the intricate detail of the cupola from the inside.</p>
