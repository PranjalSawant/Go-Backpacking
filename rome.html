      <p>Rome is one of the most iconic and most traveled cities in Europe, with a long history to match. With a mixture of cultures from around the world, Rome has it all. Wander the cobblestone street with gelato in hand, spend some time people watching from the Spanish Steps and take in all of the stunning architecture the city has to offer. Rome is also a foodie's heaven, from the world-class cuisine, to casual trattorias, to takeaway pizzas.</p> 
      <p>Rome is a big city with a great transportation system and friendly locals. I would recommend knowing a few key phrases in Italian but you will find many English speakers around in case you need assistance.</p>
      <p>Language: Modern-day Romans speak Italian, of course, which is widely recognized as a language of love and romance. There are a lot of English-speakers around Rome as well.</p>
      <p>Currency: Italy uses the euro (EUR). Currently, $1 U.S. dollar will get you €.86 euro.</p>
      <p>Credit Cards and Banks: Cards are used all over Rome, especially Visa, but it’s more common to use cash for small items. Some museums and market sellers only accept notes. As a general rule of thumb, bring a few euros in cash with you wherever you go.</p>
      <p>Climate: Resting just off the Mediterranean Sea, Rome enjoys warm and temperate weather with averages of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Expect much more rainfall during the winter and hot and sunny days in the summer.</p>
      <p>April to June and late September to October are the best months for traveling in Italy — temperatures are usually mild and the crowds aren’t quite so intense.</p>
