      <p>Language: South Africa claims a whopping eleven official languages but the most common you’ll hear in and around Cape Town is English—the lingo of business and media—followed by Afrikaans and Xhosa on the streets.</p>
      <p>Currency: The currency in South Africa is called a Rand. 1 USD is equivalent to 13.54 Rand.</p> 
      <p>Credit Cards and Banks: The majority of retailers and restaurants accept debit cards as payment.</p>
      <p>Climate: Humidity is quite low in Cape Town, so while the summers are hot, they aren’t too muggy. Wintertime, however, is chilly with the ocean winds blowing in from the southeast. The best times to visit are the cusp months, October and November, springtime in South Africa, or from December to February when the days are at their longest and warmest. Winter from June to August tends to be rainy and cold.</p>
      <p>Safety: Cape Town is one of the safer cities in South Africa, but there are still some petty crimes. Be sure to lock up your valuables and keep important belongings on your person.</p>    
      <p>There are few vistas as breathtaking as the oceanic drive around Cape Point. It’s possible to do the road trip in one day but I’d suggest breaking it up into two days so you have more time to explore and experience things along the way.</p>
