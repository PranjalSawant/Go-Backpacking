      <p>From discovering secret waterfalls and stargazing, to checking out the epic surf and catching a glimpse of an erupting volcano, Hawaii is full of surprises! This Hawaii travel blog will give you a flavour of all the amazing things to do on the islands.</p>
      <p>Hawaii is brimming with culture and every few miles you travel presents a whole new terrain. Along with a few Hawaiian delicacies (poke, shave ice etc) there’s incredible Asian food including sushi and ramen. The beaches and sunsets are just as stunning as in the movies, but the volcanoes, lava fields and waterfalls are what make the Hawaiian Islands truly unique. </p> 
      <p>Kilauea Volcano erupted with 1900 ft swells of lava in 1959, and while it’s not guaranteed to be super active when you visit, you should see some lava in the mile wide crater. Head to the lookout in Volcanoes National Park for the best view of the inferno!</p>
      <p>Waterfalls are a dime a dozen in Hawaii, and they really do vary as you travel around. The Big Island is the place for true adventurers, and if you book onto a tour you could be taken to secret falls on private land!</p>
      <p>One of the best ways to take in Hawaii as a whole is by hiring a car and road trippin’ around. On Oahu there are several viewpoints with towering mountains, jutting rocks and ferocious waves. Be sure to check out Blowhole Point and Makapu’u – two beautiful spots with really dramatic views.</p>
