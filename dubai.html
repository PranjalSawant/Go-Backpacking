      <p>Most people use Dubai as a stopover destination. They fly in, spend a night or two, then fly onward to their final destination. While Dubai is often seen as “Vegas in the desert,” there is a surprising amount of things to do here. There’s depth to the city that its popular image doesn’t accurately portray.</p>
      <p>Dubai is a city trapped between the old and the new. A place in a conservative culture with old-world customs while at the same time a Middle-Eastern Vegas where anything goes (so long as it’s behind closed doors). I was surprised at how much there was to do in this city — and how even in a week I was still left longing for more.</p> 
      <p>Dubai is a part of the Islamic nation means its culture, customs and traditions are deeply entrenched in its religious roots. Despite its conservative culture, it’s a liberal Arabian metropolis that respects and (of course) welcomes diverse world cultures and traditions wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p>Best Time to Visit: You can travel to Dubai during any part of the year, however, the most recommended time is during the cool, pleasant winter months (November to April), particularly if you enjoy the outdoors or want to participate in popular events like DSF (Dubai Shopping Festival). Al though Dubai never slows during summer months (May to September), it’s still good to know that the temperature outside will be exceedingly high reaching up to 55 degrees Celsius.</p>
