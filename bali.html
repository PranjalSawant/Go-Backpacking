        <p>Bali is a favorite destination for many people around the world and it’s easy to see why! From its list of unending idyllic beaches, captivating spiritual energy, terraced rice fields and exotic sunsets. There is so much to see and experience on this magnificent island paradise!
            Going to Bali feels like going on a never-ending adventure – there is an activity to suit every soul! Experience surfing, yoga, meditation, trekking, delicious food or amazing nightlife. Certain areas of Bali have been influenced by tourism, with hubs of cute cafes, hip bars, and vegan restaurants. Other areas are still quite remote, maintaining their uniquely Balinese beauty and charm.</p>
            <p>Language: The main languages spoken in Bali are Indonesian, Balinese and English.
            <p>Currency: The currency of Bali is the Indonesian Rupiah. 1 USD is equivalent to about 14016,00 IDR.</p>
            <p>Credit Cards and ATMs: There are plenty of ATMs in Bali’s main cities like Ubud and Canggu. As long as you’re not eating at local ‘warung’ restaurants, you can pay for your meal with your credit card, but cash is preferred.</p>
            <p>Safety: Bali is one of the safest destinations for solo female travelers! The biggest thing you need to watch out for is road safety, especially if you’re renting a motorbike. Take a taxi if you’re not a confident rider. It will always be cheaper than a hospital bill.</p>
